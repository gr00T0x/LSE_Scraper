# London Stock Exchange Web Scraper


* A simple python application that scrapes the London Stock Exchange and displays the current FTSE 100 figures. Also gives you the option to check another FTSE table by inputting the name of the table into the CLI.

* It uses no external libraries and only urllib.request for making requests to the website.
